Red color contours represent right eye and upper lip.
The green colored rectangle is created using dlib library (dlib.get_frontal_face_detector()) and the blue colored rectangle is generated using the opencv library('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml').
Two rectangles bounding the face have been shown just forthe sake of comparison.
